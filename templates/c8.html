                    <b>The Problem statement is :</b> In a large parking lot, it is difficult and time-consuming to manually count the number of vehicles present at any given
                    time. This leads to inefficiencies in managing the parking lot and can result in overcrowding or underutilization of
                    parking spaces. The use of drones for vehicle counting in parking lots can provide a faster and more accurate way of
                    counting the number of vehicles present. However, the challenge lies in developing an automated system for drone-based
                    vehicle counting that can handle the complexities of a large parking lot with multiple levels and structures, varying
                    lighting conditions, and occlusions caused by obstacles such as pillars and other parked vehicles.
                </p>
                <br>
                 <p>
                    <b>The Probable Solution is :</b> A mechanized framework for drone-based vehicle including in 
                     parking garages can be created utilizing PC vision and AI methods. A deep neural network would be
                     trained for the system to recognize and count the number of vehicles in the parking lot. An extensive
                     set of images of vehicles in various lighting conditions and with varying occlusions caused by obstacles would be
                     used to train the network. The high-resolution camera on the drone would allow it to take pictures of the cars as it flew over the
                     parking lot. The trained neural network would be used to process the images after they were sent to a computer. By dividing the parking lot 
                     into smaller regions and processing each region separately, the system would be able to deal with the complexity of a large parking lot with 
                     multiple levels and structures. The solution would make it possible to count the number of cars in the parking lot more quickly and accurately,
                     allowing for better parking lot management and avoiding overcrowding or underuse of parking spaces.

                    <b>Image Acquisition: </b>The first step is to acquire high-quality images of the plants in the
                    farm. This can be done using cameras or drones, depending on the size of the farm and the types of
                    plants.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    <b>Image Preprocessing:</b>The acquired images may have some noise or artifacts that can affect the
                    accuracy of the plant counting and classification. Therefore, the images need to be preprocessed to
                    enhance their quality. Techniques such as noise reduction, image sharpening, and contrast
                    enhancement can be applied to improve the images.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    <b>Segmentation:</b> The next step is to separate the plants from the background in the images. This
                    can be done using segmentation techniques such as thresholding, edge detection, and region growing.
                    Once the plants are segmented, they can be analyzed and counted separately.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    <b>Feature Extraction:</b> To differentiate the types of plants, various features can be extracted
                    from the segmented images. These features can include the shape, size, color, texture, and other
                    characteristics of the plants.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    <b>Classification:</b>The extracted features can be used to classify the plants into different types
                    using machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks
                    (ANN), or decision trees.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    <b>Counting:</b>Finally, the number of plants of each type can be determined by counting the
                    segmented regions that belong to each type of plant.

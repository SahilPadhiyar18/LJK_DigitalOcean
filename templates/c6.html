                    <b>The Problem statement is :</b> The objective of this project is to find the presence and location of water in a lake using a drone. This can be a
                    challenging task because water bodies can have varying depths, and their surfaces can be covered with vegetation, which
                    makes it difficult to identify the presence of water visually. Additionally, large lakes may require extensive scanning,
                    which can be time-consuming and expensive. A drone equipped with advanced sensors and imaging technology could provide
                    an efficient and cost-effective solution to this problem. The challenge is to develop an accurate and reliable method of
                    detecting and mapping water bodies using a drone.
                </p>
                <br>
                 <p>
                    <b>The Probable Solution is :</b> To precisely identify and plan water bodies in a lake utilizing a robot, a 
                     blend of cutting edge sensors and imaging innovation can be used. A multispectral camera that can capture
                     images at various wavelengths of light can be attached to the drone, making it possible to identify water 
                     bodies and vegetation. A LiDAR sensor, which can accurately measure the water's depth, can also be added 
                     to the drone. A map of the lake, including the locations of water bodies and their depths, would be created 
                     from the data gathered by these sensors through computer vision and machine learning methods. Additionally,
                     the drone can be programmed to fly in a predetermined pattern over the lake in order to quickly capture images and data. 
                     The arrangement would give an exact and dependable technique for distinguishing and planning water bodies in a
                     lake utilizing a robot, making the undertaking more productive and savvy than customary strategies.

                    <b>Image Acquisition: </b>The first step is to acquire high-quality images of the plants in the
                    farm. This can be done using cameras or drones, depending on the size of the farm and the types of
                    plants.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    <b>Image Preprocessing:</b>The acquired images may have some noise or artifacts that can affect the
                    accuracy of the plant counting and classification. Therefore, the images need to be preprocessed to
                    enhance their quality. Techniques such as noise reduction, image sharpening, and contrast
                    enhancement can be applied to improve the images.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    <b>Segmentation:</b> The next step is to separate the plants from the background in the images. This
                    can be done using segmentation techniques such as thresholding, edge detection, and region growing.
                    Once the plants are segmented, they can be analyzed and counted separately.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    <b>Feature Extraction:</b> To differentiate the types of plants, various features can be extracted
                    from the segmented images. These features can include the shape, size, color, texture, and other
                    characteristics of the plants.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    <b>Classification:</b>The extracted features can be used to classify the plants into different types
                    using machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks
                    (ANN), or decision trees.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    <b>Counting:</b>Finally, the number of plants of each type can be determined by counting the
                    segmented regions that belong to each type of plant.

                    <b>The Problem statement is :</b> Inter-communication among different drones during a collaborative task is crucial for efficient and effective operation.
                    However, there is a lack of a reliable and effective system for inter-drone communication. The current technology is
                    limited to a point-to-point communication system between drones, which is prone to failures and signal interference.
                    
                    The problem is to design and develop a robust inter-communication system for drones that can provide seamless
                    communication between multiple drones during collaborative tasks. The system should be able to handle real-time data
                    transfer, signal interference, and other environmental factors that affect communication.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>The Probable Solution is :</b> The proposed solution should improve the efficiency of drone operations, reduce the chances of errors and failures, and
                    enhance the overall performance of the drone network.To address the challenge of inter-drone communication, 
                    a robust communication system can be developed using a combination of wireless communication technologies 
                    and advanced algorithms. The system can be based on a mesh network topology, where each drone is equipped with 
                    a wireless communication module that can transmit and receive data from other drones. The system can be designed
                    to dynamically allocate communication resources based on the availability of bandwidth and signal strength, ensuring
                    efficient data transfer during collaborative tasks. The communication protocol can also be optimized for real-time data
                    transfer, with low latency and high reliability. The system can be equipped with advanced algorithms that can detect and
                    mitigate signal interference caused by environmental factors such as wind and other wireless devices. Additionally, the
                    system can also be designed to be scalable, easily adaptable to different drone types and environments, and provide a
                    high level of security to prevent unauthorized access. The proposed solution would provide a robust and reliable inter-communication system
                    for drones, enabling efficient and effective operation during collaborative tasks

                    <b>Communication between drones: </b>Communication between drones is crucial for coordinated missions such as search and rescue, package delivery, and surveillance. 
                    Techniques such as ad-hoc networks, swarm intelligence, and wireless communication protocols like Bluetooth, WiFi,
                    and LTE can be used to enable communication between drones. Communication systems can also be
                    enhanced with techniques such as error correction, data compression, and encryption to ensure reliable and secure communication between the drones.

              <p>
                    <b>Path planning:</b>Path planning in intercommunication between drones is crucial for efficient and safe coordination. It involves designing 
                  algorithms that enable drones to communicate and exchange information, such as location and velocity, and plan their paths accordingly. Various
                  techniques are used for path planning, including graph-based algorithms, potential fields, and machine learning. These techniques 
                  consider factors such as drone capabilities, obstacles, and environmental conditions to determine the optimal path for each drone in real-time.

                <p>
                    <b>An intercommunication failure system:</b> An intercommunication failure system for drones can be designed to ensure the safety of the drones
                    and people on the ground. The system can detect communication failures between the drones and the ground station and provide an alert to the drone operator.
                    The system can also initiate an emergency protocol to bring the drones to
                    a safe location and land them. Backup communication channels and redundant systems can be utilized to minimize the risk of communication failures.

                    <b>Path visualization :</b>Path visualization by drone involves using drones to capture images or videos of a particular path or route. 
                These images or videos can be analyzed to create a 3D model of the path or route, which can be used for further analysis, planning, and visualization. 
                Path visualization by drone is useful in many industries, such as transportation,
                construction, and agriculture, as it allows for more accurate and efficient planning and analysis of routes and paths.

                  <p>
                    <b>Stereo vision:</b>Stereo vision is a technique that uses two or more cameras to capture images of the same scene from slightly different angles.
                      By analyzing the differences in the images, a depth map can
                      be generated, which allows for 3D reconstruction of the scene. 
                      Stereo vision has many applications, including object tracking, autonomous navigation, and 3D modeling.
